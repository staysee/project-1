#Battleship

_This is the first game/project I built on Week 3 of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program._

_**Search for your enemy's ships hiding in the treacherous waters. Sink all of your enemy ships by guessing all 5 ship locations before your opponent sinks yours!**_

###How to Play
Player 1 starts. Take turns firing shots at your opponent's grid. If a ship occupies the square being shot, it will return a _HIT_. Otherwise it is a _MISS_.
The game ends when a player sinks all 5 ships of their enemy fleet.

**Fleet** - _Ship name & Length_

* Aircraft Carrier 5
* Battleship 4
* Submarine 3
* Destroyer 3
* Patrol Boat 2

###Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery

###Ice Box
I wasn't able to create custom ship placements - they are currently hard coded into the game. Players were supposed to be able rotate each ship vertically/horizontally and place them.
