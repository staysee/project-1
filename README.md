<h1>Battleship</h1>

<p> Used HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery to create a 2-player game of Battleship</p>

<h5>Goal of the Game</h5>
  <p>Sink all of your enemy ships by guessing all 5 ship locations before your opponent sinks yours!

<h5>Unsolved Problems/Future Additions</h5>
  <p>I wasn't able to do ship placements. Currently they are hard coded into the game. I wanted to have each ship be placed
  by the player and rotate vertially/horizontally. The game is currently missing a turn-logic to prevent the wrong player from going twice.
